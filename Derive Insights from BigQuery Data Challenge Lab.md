## Create ML Models with BigQuery ML: Challenge Lab [SOLUTION]
This guide is for ```customer_classification_model```, please read your instruction lab task 2 carefully <br/>
If you have to make ```predicts_visitor_model``` please move to [this guide lab](https://github.com/cloudlabguru/gcp-cloudskillboost/blob/main/Create%20ML%20Models%20with%20BigQuery%20ML/%5Bpredicts_visitor_model%5D%20Create%20ML%20Models%20with%20BigQuery%20ML%3A%20Challenge%20Lab.md)

### Task 1. Create a new dataset
* Open BigQuery
* Create dataset ```bq_dataset```

### Task 2. Evaluate classification model performance
Run this script in BigQuery Editor
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `ecommerce.customer_classification_model`
OPTIONS
(
model_type='logistic_reg',
labels = ['will_buy_on_return_visit']
)
AS
#standardSQL
SELECT
* EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
FROM
# features
(SELECT
fullVisitorId,
IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
WHERE totals.newVisits = 1
AND date BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170430') # train on first 9 months
JOIN
(SELECT
fullvisitorid,
IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
GROUP BY fullvisitorid)
USING (fullVisitorId)
;

SELECT
  roc_auc,
  CASE
    WHEN roc_auc > .9 THEN 'good'
    WHEN roc_auc > .8 THEN 'fair'
    WHEN roc_auc > .7 THEN 'decent'
    WHEN roc_auc > .6 THEN 'not great'
  ELSE 'poor' END AS model_quality
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL ecommerce.customer_classification_model,  (

SELECT
  * EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
FROM
  # features
  (SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
    IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  WHERE
    totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20170501' AND '20170630') # eval on 2 months
  JOIN
  (SELECT
    fullvisitorid,
    IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid)
  USING (fullVisitorId)
));
```

### Task 3. Improve model performance with Feature Engineering and Evaluate the model to see if there is better predictive power
Run this script in BigQuery Editor
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `ecommerce.improved_customer_classification_model`

  IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid
)

# add in new features
SELECT * EXCEPT(unique_session_id) FROM (

  SELECT
      CONCAT(fullvisitorid, CAST(visitId AS STRING)) AS unique_session_id,

      trafficSource.source,
      trafficSource.medium,
      channelGrouping,

      # mobile or desktop
      device.deviceCategory,

      IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country

Run this script in BigQuery Editor
```sql
SELECT
